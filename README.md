Heart of Gold - Social Good Chrome Extension
====================================================

This extension detects whether the user has made an online purchase and based on
that amount, suggests a round-up donation to the nearest dollar. All round-ups
are stored in a virtual wallet, and once a $5 threshold is passed, the user may
donate all their accumulated change to a charity of their choice. Over time, the
user can see how much they have donated.

Information is stored using Firebase, and payments are processed using the
PayPal API. The rest of the extension was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
jQuery, and AJAX.

This was built by Yong Li Dich, Miles Fertel, and Lisa Lu for HackMIT 2017.
